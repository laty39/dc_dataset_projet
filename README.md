# dcinside Open Dataset Project
📢 **A Large-Scale Korean Online Community Dataset for AI & NLP Research**

## Overview  
The **dcinside Open Dataset Project** aims to collect, clean, and structure publicly available text data from **dcinside**, one of South Korea’s largest and most active online communities.  
This dataset is designed to support **Korean language AI development**, including:  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
- **Sentiment Analysis**  
- **Korean Internet Culture Research**  

## Why dcinside?  
dcinside (디시인사이드) is a major online community in South Korea known for its:  
✔ **Diverse discussions** across thousands of user-created forums (galleries).  
✔ **Colloquial & humorous language**, rich in memes and evolving Korean expressions.  
✔ **Large volume of public text data**, useful for AI training on **natural Korean conversation styles**.  

## Goals  
🚀 **Create a high-quality, large-scale Korean text dataset** for AI research.  
📜 **Preserve and analyze Korean internet culture**, including slang and online discourse.  
🛡 **Ensure the dataset adheres to ethical and legal standards**, making it openly accessible to researchers and developers.  

## Features  
- ✅ **High-volume** text data from multiple discussion boards.  
- ✅ **Preprocessed and structured** for AI/ML training (spam and irrelevant data removed).  
- ✅ **Anonymized** to protect user privacy.  
- ✅ Available in **structured formats (JSON, CSV, etc.)** for easy integration into AI models.  

## Challenges  
⚠ **Data filtering & preprocessing** – Handling informal, unstructured content.  
⚠ **Balancing ethical considerations** – Ensuring removal of sensitive or identifiable data.  
⚠ **Community involvement** – Seeking contributors for data collection, cleaning, and annotation.  

## How to Contribute  
We are looking for **AI researchers, developers, and linguists** interested in:  
✔ Data collection and preprocessing  
✔ Korean NLP and AI training  
✔ Ethical AI research
